* Next Steps

** TODO Simulations [0/3]
- [ ] Simulate Data from basic versions of model
- [ ] Fit Bayesian SSM models to the simulated data and try to recover the parameters
- [ ] Create some informative graphics for these

** TODO Set up a GitHub Repo

* State Space Models
** Assumptions
- SSMs assume the state process is a markov proces (state at time t depends only on state t-1)
- Observations are independent after accounting for states

** Continuous Time
- It may be beneficial to use a continuous time model for the telemetry because the data are recorded at unequal time intervals (and the process is intrinsically continuous)

** Discrete Time
- If you want to do the model on lap times, then discrete may be an option since each time unit could be a lap

** Multivariate Structural Time Series
- Basically, your observations y_t are a vector now.  This allows you to model multiple responses and define a correlation structure between them
  
* Data Cleaning Considerations

** Pit Laps

** Laps in which the driver is close to a car in front

** First Two or three laps of each stint
- Should be gotten rid of most likely since the driver will be bringing the tires into the "temperature window"
  
** Fuel corrected laptimes
- Will potentially want to adjust the laptimes by .03 seconds a lap for loss of fuel
- Could ask about the possibility of estimating this quantity

* Backlog/Ideas for later

** Need to find a way to incorporate other drivers/constructors and tire type in the model
- Right now the model only works for a single driver
  - Might be able to add covariates for the driver
  
** Perhaps a way to incorporate telemetry data
- Need to learn about ODEs most likely

** What really is \alpha in the model?
- Is it the true pace or average pace of the driver

** Could we consider the season as a time series and find covariates that help predict tire degredation differences from grand prix to grand prix?  

** How to choose optimal starting values for Bayesian implementation

* Misc Questions

** Thinking about applying to phd programs
- Could Measure Theory be a good course to take next semester in the math department ?
- If not, could I also take mathematical optimization ?
